# leetcode-journey

- This is my own repository to document my own editorials and work on leetcode and trying to get better at competitive programming or coding interview questions.
- I have it public just so if anyone wants to check in on a less editorial style explanation but rather based on a "insight" reflection approach. Basically trying to understand what would lead to the discovery of a given solution from my own perspective. Maybe it will help maybe it won't hopefully it will though
